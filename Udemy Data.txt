//Refernece Type and Value Type

1. Primitive Types known as value types:
		and these are cover under Structs (take less space)
		When you create a variable that is a value type. when we call them a part of memory called Stack is allocated for that 
		variable. This memory allocation is done automatically so you don't have to worry about it. And these are removed early.


2. Non- Primitive Types are known as refernece types:
		and these are cover under classes. We allocate space for them. We store them on heap. Does not remove early.

3. Copy of any array (which is itself build on heap, will be on stcak as it is copy and removed earlier)

1. for Loop
2. foreach loop
3. while loop
4. do while loop
5. break
6. continue 

//Lecture 47
//Space Check
Tupe 1: 
	if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Name))
	break;
Type 2:
	if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Name))
	continue;

//Arrays and Lists

Arrays:
	Single D:
	Multi D:
		1. Rectangular:
			var array = new Array[3][4];
		2. Jagged:
			var array = new Array[3][];
