			//Favour Composition over Inheritance

			1. Problem with Inheritance
			Advantages: 
					Code- Resue/ AND EASY TO RESUE
			DisAdvantages:
					1. Easily absued by designers/developers
					2. Large hierarchies
					3. Fragility
					4. Cause Tighlty Coupling
			EXAMPLE: Living things in a house i.e. Human/ Animals both of them can eat/steep/walk but what if we add fish, can fish walk?? this is error.


			2. Advantages of Composition(Association) over Inheritance
				Inheritance relation can be converted to compoition. This is FLEXIBILITY.

			EXAMPLE: Same as used in Inheritance:
				Living things in a house i.e. Human/ Animals both of them can eat/steep/walk but what if we add fish, can fish walk?? this is error.
			NO it is not ERROR here. we crear new classes. 
			Different Classes:

			Person
			Dog
			Fish
			Duck 

			Classes(Functions): Animal, Walkable, Swiimmable:
			This give us fleixbel and lose coupling

			SUMMARY:
				2 TYPES OF CLASSES:
					1. INHERITANCE (IS-A RELATIONSHIP)
					2.  COMPOSITION (HAS- A RELATIONSHIP)
