                WHAT ARE INTERFACES:
	            An interface is a language construct that is similar to class in terms of syntax but it's fundamentally
                Starts with "I".
                public interface ITaxcalculator
                {
                int Calculator();
                }
                    Don't have implementation
                    no brakets
                    no data types:

                WHY WE NEED It?
                To build loosely-coupled Applications.
        
                It has methods but no body.
                They Improve Testibiliy and Extensibility
